# Sphere-Sumo-Game

Welcome to Sphere sumo. The objective of the game is to attempt to knock enemy spheres off of the island and survive as many waves of enemies as possible. The game starts off with just one enemy and for each wave, an additional enemy gets added, causing the game to increase in difficulty. A power up also spawns at the beginning of each wave that only the player can pick up. The power up increases the player's collision power for about 10 seconds.

Controls
- Up and down arrows move the player vertically
- Left and right arrows rotate the entire island
